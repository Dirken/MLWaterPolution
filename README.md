# Final degree project 2017-2018, FIB-UPC.

## Title
System that predicts the origin of fecal matter contamination in water.

## Motivation
I am interested in ML since last semester where I did Titanic Kaggle challenge and I really enjoyed the process of doing it. Since then I want to prove again my skills in ML and I want to see if I'm good enough to keep in ML/data science world.

## Abstract
Using microbiogical analysis of water and combining it with Machine Learning techniques, we will construct a system to detect the source of polution (animals species) and also to detect the total contribution of each specie. We will build an interactive website that allows the user to introduce microbiological information, visualize, create and execute prediction models and interact with the results. This project has interest of Universitat de Barcelona (UB) microbiological department.

## Technologies

Pending

## Observations
I will not upload the dataset used because it's not public data.
